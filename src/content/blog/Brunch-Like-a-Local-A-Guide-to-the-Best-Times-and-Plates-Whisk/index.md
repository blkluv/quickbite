## New Here? Let Us Show You How to Brunch Like a Local

If you've never been to Whisk Breakfast & Brunch, welcome! Whether you just moved to the area, you're visiting from out of town, or simply haven't gotten around to it yet, we're here to give you the inside scoop on how to brunch like a true local.

Because once you know, you know.

## What Time the Magic Happens

**✨ Weekdays (Hidden Gem Alert):**
If you love a laid-back brunch vibe with no wait, pop in Tuesday through Thursday. The food hits just as hard, and you'll get your favorite seat with ease.

**✨ Fridays & Weekends (Peak Brunch Energy):**
This is when Whisk comes alive! Groups of friends, birthday brunches, and tables full of people living their best life. Come early (before 11am) to beat the rush, or lean into the energy with a mimosa in hand.

## 🍽️ Plates Locals Swear By

We've got options. But here are the go-to favorites locals order on repeat:

**French Toast Bites** – Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and dusted with cinnamon sugar. A must-try starter or sweet side.

**Smoked Oxtail Hash** – Our "fall off the bone" oxtails, served with seasoned potatoes, eggs, and a whole lot of soul.

**Fish & Grits** – Golden fried fish paired with buttery grits. Simple, Southern, and unforgettable.

**Steak and Eggs** – Juicy, tender steak cooked to your liking, paired with perfectly seasoned eggs and your choice of sides. It's bold, hearty, and built to keep you full all day.

**Breakfast Board** – Our most "Instagram-worthy" plate and fully customizable. Pick your favorites from our most popular dishes: pancakes, wings, eggs, bacon, French toast bites, and more. It's made your way, served on a board, and built to impress (and feed the whole table if you're feeling generous).

## 🥂 What to Sip On

Because brunch without a drink? We don't know her.

- **Mimosas** (classic or flavored!)
- **Chilly Start** (Chilled espresso, vanilla bean, simple syrup, Uncle Nearest Bourbon, milk of choice with cinnamon dusting)
- **Morning Butterfly** (Empress Gin, lemon juice, lavender syrup, and chilled sparkling wine)
- **Caramel Brûlée Coffee** (A rich blend of espresso, silky caramel, and smooth vanilla, topped with whipped cream, a caramel drizzle, and a sprinkle of toffee for that perfect sweet crunch)

## 🤫 A Few Local Tips You Didn't Hear From Us...

- **Ask about our specialty drinks.** Our talented bartenders are always thinking of new drinks that bring flavor and life to your brunch.

- **Follow us on Instagram** ([@whiskAtlanta](https://instagram.com/whiskAtlanta)) for special events. Whisk is all about working with the community, and that means collaborating to create beautiful moments for everyone brunching with us.

- **Coming with a big group?** Call ahead or [message us](https://cal.com/atl5d/whisk) to reserve and we'll help make it a vibe.

## 💛 Come Hungry, Leave a Regular

At Whisk, we're not just about great food, we're about creating a space where people feel good, eat well, and want to come back again and again.

So next time you're craving something real, skip the chain spots and brunch like a local.
