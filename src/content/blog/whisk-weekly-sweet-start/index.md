## This Week's Insider Scoop: Acai Dreams & Citrus Glow Ups

At Whisk, we believe mornings should start with intention. Doesn't matter if you're fueling up for a busy day or lingering over a slow brunch - this week, we're spotlighting two favorites that capture the heart of what we do: fresh, elevated takes on your morning staples.

## The Whisk Weekly Acai Bowl You'll Crave Again Tomorrow

Vibrant, refreshing, and almost too pretty to eat, our acai bowl is more than just a trend. It's a layered experience. We start with a rich, chilled acai blend, then top it with fresh fruit, granola, and a drizzle of honey. It's light but filling, the perfect balance of flavor, texture, and feel-good energy.

## Grapefruit Brûlée: Your New Morning Ritual

If you haven't tried our grapefruit brûlée, consider this your sign. A caramelized sugar shell meets the juicy, tart brightness of fresh grapefruit, creating a contrast that's both indulgent and refreshing. It's simple, beautiful, and just different enough to turn heads at your table. A spoonful of this and you'll understand why it's become a quiet favorite.

## Why Whisk?

Whether you're coming for fruit-forward freshness or something heartier (yes, we still do steak, eggs, and grits like no one else), Whisk is all about options without ever losing the vibe.

Cozy booths, a full bar, and dishes that meet you where you are - whether that's post-workout, post-mimosa, or somewhere in between.
